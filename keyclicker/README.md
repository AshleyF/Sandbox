# KeyClicker

A simple app to play keyboard sound effects as keys are pressed. Hooks events system-wide (leave running in the background while typing in any foreground app).

TODO: Sound doesn't keep up with reasonable typing speed (play overlapped audio, etc.)
TODO: Perhaps separate sounds would be nice for spacebar, enter, backspace, ...
